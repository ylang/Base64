Implementation of Base64 data encoding/decoding per http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648[RFC4648].

There is also a GUI to play around with the encoding and decoding library.
Make sure that you have the "gui" branch of the library.  The master branch does not
provide the GUI test tool.

== Usage
Encoding and decoding using the Base64 library is extremely simple.


.Encoding Example
----
private String input = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";
String result = Base64.encode(input.getBytes());
----

.Decoding Example
----
private String output = "VGhlIHF1aWNrIGJyb3duIGZveCBqdW1wcyBvdmVyIHRoZSBsYXp5IGRvZy4=";
String result = new String(Base64.decode(output));
----

NOTE: Both encoding and decoding requires byte arrays.  This allows you to Base64 encode/decode binary data.
